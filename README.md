This system was created by me and my partner jacob-cruz.

This is our Final Project for our subject System Integration, where we individually created the main sub-system 
and integrate the systems to one main system.

To run the System Download the Final Project Folder.

2) Run Apache and MySQL
3) Make the "file_upload = On" in 'php.ini' of 'Apache' by clicking config
4) Import the included testdb.sql in the MySQL
5) Finally, search and run the localhost:xxxx/Final-Project/index.html
